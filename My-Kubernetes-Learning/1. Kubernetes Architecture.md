### What is Kubernetes, and why is it used?
- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It ensures that application workloads are highly available, resilient, and able to scale dynamically based on demand.

#### Benefits:
1. **Scalability** – Easily scale applications up or down based on traffic.
2. **Fault tolerance** – Automatically replaces failed containers to maintain application health.
3. **Automated deployment and management** – Simplifies rolling updates, rollbacks, and deployment pipelines.
4. **Efficient resource utilization** – Distributes workloads efficiently across the infrastructure.
5. **Service discovery and load balancing** – Makes it easier to manage and expose services in a distributed environment.

# Kubernetes Architecture.
<img>

**Cluster:** 
 - A Kubernetes cluster is a group of **master (control plane)** and **worker nodes** that run containerized applications and services in a highly available and scalable environment.
---
### 1. **Control Plane / Master Node:**
- The master node is responsible for managing the overall state of the cluster.
Components on the master node include:
1. API Server
2. Scheduler
3. ETCD
4. Controller-Manager

* **1.API Server:**
  The API server is responsible for exposing the Kubernetes API. It is the front-end of the control plane and acts as the central management point for all interactions with the cluster, including requests from users, tools, or external systems.

* **2.Scheduler:**
  The scheduler assigns pods to nodes based on resource availability and constraints. It maintains all worker node details (e.g., CPU, memory, disk space, etc.).

* **3.ETCD:**
  ETCD is a consistent and highly available key-value store used for storing all cluster data, configurations, and secrets.

* **4.Controller-Manager:**
  The controller-manager is responsible for monitoring the health of nodes and ensuring the desired state of the cluster is maintained. It watches the state of the cluster and takes corrective actions, sending instructions to the API server as needed.

  **Controllers include:**

  1. **ReplicaSet Controller:** Ensures the specified number of pod replicas are running. It is now typically managed as part of the Deployment Controller in newer versions.
  2. **Node Controller:** Monitors node health and ensures nodes are responsive.
  3. **Service Controller:** Ensures that external load balancers are created and maintained for services with a `LoadBalancer` type.

### 2. **Worker Node:**
- Worker nodes are responsible for deploying, running, and managing containerized applications.
* **1.Kubelet:**
  The kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It is responsible for managing the state of the node and ensuring that containers are running and healthy by starting, stopping, and restarting them as needed.

* **2.Kube-Proxy:**
  Kube-proxy manages network traffic within the cluster. It handles networking rules, routing, and load balancing as defined by the controller manager.

* **3.Pod:**
  A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage.

* **4.Container:**
  A container is a lightweight, portable unit that runs inside a pod and contains the application code along with its dependencies and environment.

### **What is kubectl?**

**kubectl** is a command-line tool that enables communication between the Kubernetes API and the control plane. It is used to manage the cluster, deploy applications, and inspect resources.

### Kubernetes Cluster Setup:
There are multiple ways to setup kubernetes cluster.
1. Self Manager K8'S Cluster.
   - a. Mini Kube (Single node cluster).
   - b. Kubeadm(Multi node cluster)
   - c. KOPS.ect.
2. Cloud Managed K8'S Cluster.
   - a. AWS - EKS
   - b. Azure - AKS
   - c. GCP - GKS
   - d. IBM - IKE
   
#### Mini Kube:
- It is a tool used to setup single node cluster on K8's.
- It contains API Servers, ETCD databased and container runtime.
- It helps you to containerized applications and used to for development, testing and experimentation purposes on local. 
**Note:Butwe don't implement this in real-time**

### What Problems Does Kubernetes Solve.

1. **Users expect applications and services to be available 24/7.**- Kubernetes ensures high availability and can automatically recover from failures.

2. **Developers expect to deploy code multiple times a day with no downtime.**- Kubernetes supports rolling updates and rollbacks to enable seamless, zero-downtime deployments.

3. **Companies desire more efficient use of cloud resources.**- Kubernetes optimizes resource usage by efficient container scheduling and scaling.

4. **Fault-tolerant and self-healing infrastructure improves reliability.**- Kubernetes automatically restarts failed containers and reschedules them on healthy nodes.

5. **Automated horizontal scaling at both node and container (pod) level.**- Kubernetes supports auto-scaling of pods based on CPU/memory usage and can also scale nodes in cloud environments.
