## what are the major limitations of docker that Kubernetes overcome ?
**In short:** Docker is great for building and running containers, but Kubernetes adds orchestration, automation, and resilienceâ€”making it ideal for production-scale deployments.
| **Docker Limitation**                         | **How Kubernetes Solves It**                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **No native orchestration**                   | Kubernetes handles scheduling, scaling, and managing containers.                    |
| **Manual container scaling**                  | Kubernetes provides auto-scaling of pods based on resource usage.                   |
| **No service discovery/load balancing**       | Kubernetes has built-in service discovery and load balancing via Services.          |
| **Limited self-healing**                      | Kubernetes restarts failed pods and replaces unhealthy nodes automatically.         |
| **Manual rolling updates/rollbacks**          | Kubernetes supports automated rolling updates and easy rollbacks.                   |
| **No built-in monitoring/health checks**      | Kubernetes supports liveness/readiness probes and integrates with monitoring tools. |
